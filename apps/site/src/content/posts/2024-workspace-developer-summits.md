- 🇺🇸 Boston - September 12, 2024

> The event is all about building solutions on the Google Workspace platform, learning about new platform capabilities, and connecting with the Workspace developer community.

The group of developers that come to this event are typically building solutions on the Google Workspace platform and have an incredible depth of knowledge about the platform. I sometimes feel like I'm the least knowledgeable person in the room when I attend these events even though I'm on the Google Workspace Developer Relations team!
