> Cooper's team spent six months checking random addresses in the FCC's map that are considered served and compared them to local internet coverage. They typed in nearly 65,000 physical addresses into the local internet provider's "check availability" tool and found 22.1% lacked available service. 

Most of the providers at my location way overestimate their level of service, especially the Wireless ISPs (Aligntec) which are very common in Colorado.

Also, where is the latency requirement here? 500 millisecond pings with higher geostationary orbits (Hughes) should not count as broadband.
