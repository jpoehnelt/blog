The La Sportiva Cyklon Cross GTX is an ideal winter running shoe for snow and icy conditions with the built-in gaiter, GoreTex uppers, and lugs that provide traction on snow.

My typical running shoe is the Hoka Speedgoat 5 and/or TectonX. However, neither of these shoes are suitable for snow and winters in southwest Colorado. In the past I have run with traction devices that wrap around these shoes but I wanted something that didn't shift during my runs and a shoe that would keep my feet dry and warm.

Normally these shoes retail for around $235 (December 2022), but I found some on sale for $185. Considering all of the features compared to my normal running shoes, this seems like a fair price at $185. I'm not sure if I would pay full price for these shoes.

## First Impressions

After a couple runs in the snow, I was impressed with the traction and warmth of the La Sportiva Cyklon. The shoe is very comfortable with the Boa system and the lugs provide excellent traction on snow. The gaiter proved to be useful in the newly fallen foot of snow.

- **Warmth:** The GoreTex uppers kept my feet toasty in temperatures around freezing. If it was much warmer, my feet would have been sweating. Perhaps I would wear these for a shoulder season mountain ultra, however I doubt I would choose these for a run in warmer but muddy conditions.
- **Size:** I wear a size 11 in the Hoka Speedgoat 5 and TectonX. I ordered a size 11.5 in the La Sportiva Cyklon and it fits well with my normal running socks.
- **Toe Box:** The toe box is a little narrow for me and I have some pressure on my large toe. Not sure if this will stretch with more break-in. I'm still able to run 10k without any issues. The width of the rest of the shoe is fine.
- **Cushion:** The Cyklon is less cushioned than my Speedgoats and closer to the feel of the TectonX. I'm not sure how these would feel on a 30k or longer run.

## Upgrading Traction

I plan to install "hobnails" or studs on the Cyklon to provide even more traction on snow and ice. Traction in the winter is always tricky and our current running conditions aren't at that icy stage yet, but I'm sure it will be soon. I'm hoping the screws will provide enough traction to run on some icy roads and trails.

You can see that the treads for these shoes are designed to accommodate screw in studs.

## Snowshoeing

These shoes should have enough rigidity to use with snowshoes. I haven't tried this yet but I'm looking forward to it. I will update this review when I do! I have both traditional snowshoes with more float and smaller running snowshoes to try them with.

## Boa System

The Boa system is a nice feature. It's easy to tighten and loosen the shoe. With the cushioned uppers, it's easy to tighten the shoe without any discomfort and get a nice snug fit. These are my first running shoes using the Boa system and so far I'm happy with it.
