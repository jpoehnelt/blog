title: Google Drive Picker TypeScript - Types Updated
description: >-
  Last week I submitted a pull request to the DefinitelyTyped repository for the
  Google Drive Picker API. Not a big deal in itself, but these types are
  generated from the same source as the Google Drive Picker reference
  documentation and should be more correct and consistent than the community
  types that were previously in the DefinitelyTyped repository.

Last week I submited a [pull request to the DefinitelyTyped repository](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/70926) for the Google Drive Picker API. Not a big deal in itself, but these types are generated from the same source as the [Google Drive Picker reference documentation](https://developers.google.com/drive/picker/reference/picker) and _should_ be more correct and consistent than the community types that were previously in the DefinitelyTyped repository.

The versions of [`@types/google.picker`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/google.picker?activeTab=versions) in this switchover are:

- `@types/google.picker@0.0.43` === old community types
- `@types/google.picker@0.0.44` === new autogenerated types

You can update with the following command:

```sh
npm install -D @types/google.picker@^0.0.44
```

If you find any mistakes or inconsistencies in the types, please open an issue at https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=191628 and not the DefinitelyTyped repository since the Google team will need to make the changes.
