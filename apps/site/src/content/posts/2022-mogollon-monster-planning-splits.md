I just signed up for the Mogollon Monster 100 mile race for 2022. [Last year I finished in a little over 29 hours](/posts/mogollon-monster-100-2021/), good for 11th, and this year I am setting __my target at 24 hours__!

> All Mogollon Monster finishers of the race will receive a finishers buckle.  A special buckle will be awarded to those that complete the race under 24 hours.

I want that belt buckle!

## Mogollon Monster Splits

Below are the [splits for my 2021 run](https://live.aravaiparunning.com/#/mogollon_monster-2021/103314), compared to Jeff Browning, and my target finish for 2022. It's probably a little ambitious! 😂

## Changes for 2022

- No gut/nausea issues. I am better at managing this now. 💩 🚫
- Cooler temperatures. It is forecast to be cloudy and 10 degrees cooler than last year. 🌥️
- The earlier start (1 hour) and a slightly faster pace means I will be running in the pines for the hottest part of the day. 🌄
- Better fitness 🫀 🫁 💪
- More experience with 100 milers. The 2021 Mogollon Monster was my first 100 miler that I finished. 🧠
- My luck shoes that have gotten me a 1st and 2nd in my last two races 👟
- I know the course. 🧭
- Luck 🍀
