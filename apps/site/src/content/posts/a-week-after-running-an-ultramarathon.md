A week after running the Canyons 100 mile ultramarathon:

- HRV: 44 (<span class="text-red-400">-30</span>)
- Resting Heart Rate: 48 (<span class="text-red-400">+11</span>)
- Resting Respiratory Rate: 13 (<span class="text-red-400">+1</span>)

It is really amazing how long some of these activities take to recover from! I need more sleep and to keep eating!

These numbers of course are relative to me and should not really be compared across individuals.
