As a software engineer, technically "Developer Relations Engineer", I try and automate repetitive tasks as much as possible. However, I have come to realize that there is a gap or hole between manual tasks and automation where nothing gets done. I call this the Automator's Hole.

Perhaps this is a failure of my skill in automation? Maybe I need to create some macros for recording clicks? Of course the relevant xkcd, https://xkcd.com/1319, warns against this line of thinking.

In reality, I just need to do the tasks and stop procrastination. I think I'll go do that now. :grinning:
