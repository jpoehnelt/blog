> The Arizona Monster is a 309 mile point to point journey through Southern Arizona's Sonoran desert. The Sonoran desert is unique, in that it has subtropical warmth in winter and two seasons of rainfall. This creates an extreme contrast between aridity and moisture supporting diverse and vibrant flora and fauna. The route is rugged, challenging, and features some of Southern Arizona's most iconic backcountry terrain and high elevation mountains.

This sounds fun!
