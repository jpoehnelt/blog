It's kinda of fun pushing super hard. Didn't work out and I succumbed to ankle calf injuries, complete exhaustion, and nausea. Was about 30 minutes ahead of my [target split at Washington Park](/posts/2022-mogollon-monster-planning-splits/). Led for about 40 some miles which was exciting.

I wore a continuous glucose monitor for this ultramarathon and it definitely shows where I was feeling nausea and exhaustion later in the race with the massive dips.

Ended up with a 28:42:44 finish time and 15th place beating my time from [last year of 29:13:06](/posts/mogollon-monster-100-2021/).
