The [Mace's Hideout 100](https://www.tempestadventures.com/maces-hideout-100/about) was an outstanding, but brutal race put on by [Tempest Adventures](https://www.tempestadventures.com) in the Wet Mountains of eastern Colorado. The race was very low key with only 19 runners, but was incredibly well staffed at aid stations, perfectly marked, and a wonderful experience.

## About the course

There are a few main sections to this course that vary considerably and make for an interesting course!

1. Climb to Greenhorn - The initial climb from the start at Pueblo Mountain Park to the crest of the Wet Mountains and aid station at Greenhorn.
2. High Desert - The descent from Greenhorn, traverse of the desert portions, and climb back to Greenhorn aid station.
3. Crest Traverse - The Greenhorn aid station to St. Charles Peak and the unofficial aid station at Highway 165.
4. Canyon Descent - The descent (and climbs) from Highway 165 to the finish.

### Climb to Greenhorn
This is the first 18 miles of the course. It's runnable in many places, but I definitely took it easy. The last couple miles of the climb were very loose and quite steep in a number of locations.

### High Desert
This part from the Greenhorn aid station down to the lower elevation part of the course is very runnable. The biggest issue I faced here was the heat. If I was in better shape, I would have been running a lot of this section and much faster than I did. The climb back up to Greenhorn was slow for me as I kept sleep walking!

### Crest Traverse
This part of the course is very difficult to run, but I really pushed myself here, especially on the downs. This is all motorized trail, so there were a lot drops and big loose rocks. I sprained my ankle somewhere in this section during the night.

### Canyon Descent
This part seems like it will never end. Instead of going down a single canyon, it crosses up and over a few canyons just when you want to cruise down to the finish. Through in a bunch of mandatory stream crossings and it really slows you down.

## My experience

I ran this race without crew, pacers, and by myself for about 97 of the 102 miles! It was an absolutely solitary experience. There were no drones buzzing overhead and only a few other trail users.

Physically, I am really proud of my effort. I kept thinking the 4th place runner was going to catch me and I pushed myself to the limit for the last 30 miles. Although the last five miles I really slowed down, I have never had such a strong second half of a 100 miler. Typically, I fade out in the second half, but ended up 2 hours ahead of 4th and a little under 1.5 hours behind 2nd.

In all, I highly recommend the race and [Tempest Adventures](https://www.tempestadventures.com). I'm currently signed up for the [Creede 100](https://www.tempestadventures.com/creede-100/about) and [Rio Grande 100](https://www.tempestadventures.com/rio-grande-100/about) for their Triple Crown and am looking forward to these adventures and having another low key ultra experience!
