    "Historic Natchez Trace Route: The race takes place on the Yockanookany section of the Natchez Trace, a historic foot trail that dates back centuries and is now preserved as a National Scenic Trail.",
    "Horse Hoof Obstacles: Because the trail is shared with equestrians, runners must navigate unique 'hoof holes' and uneven footing that add a significant technical challenge to the rugged course.",
    "Signature Post-Race Meal: A beloved tradition of the event is the serving of freshly grilled cheese sandwiches and hot soup to finishers to help them 'beat the chill' after the winter run."
