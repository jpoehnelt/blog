  "summary": "Held in the heart of the Colorado Rockies, The Great Divide Ultra is a high-altitude trail festival that traverses the scenic rolling meadows and granite formations of Mueller State Park. Runners face a formidable test of endurance across distances ranging from 25K to 100 miles, all while surrounded by sweeping vistas of Pikes Peak.",
  "uniqueFeatures": [
    "High-Altitude Environment: The entire course is situated at a punishing elevation between 9,189 and 9,743 feet, requiring runners to contend with significantly thinner air throughout the race.",
    "Dark Divide Night Run: A standout feature of the festival is a dedicated night-start event that allows participants to experience the trails under the stars alongside the 100-mile and 100K competitors.",
    "Looped Support System: The 100-mile course utilizes a repetitive 14.8-mile loop design, which provides exceptional crew access and ensures that runners encounter well-stocked aid stations every 4 to 6 miles."
