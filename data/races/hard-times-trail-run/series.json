  "summary": "The Hard Times Trail Run is a gritty ultramarathon held in the Little Sac Woods Conservation Area near Willard, Missouri, famously known as the toughest footrace in Greene County. The 50K course is characterized by its raw, unrefined terrain featuring creek crossings, thick briars, and a total lack of switchbacks, forcing runners to take the steepest lines possible. Its small, exclusive field size creates a high-stakes, intimate atmosphere where endurance and mental fortitude are tested against the unforgiving Ozark wilderness.",

    "Washing Machine Style Laps: Participants in the 50K distance must alternate their running direction on each lap, navigating the loops both clockwise and counter-clockwise to constantly reset their perspective and physical cadence.",
    "Zero-Switchback Philosophy: Unlike typical mountain races, the course avoids switchbacks entirely, utilizing direct, soul-crushing climbs and bone-rattling descents that provide no relief for the runner's joints or lungs.",
    "Ultra-Limited Field Size: To preserve the integrity of the trail and the intimate community feel, the race is strictly limited to approximately 60 total runners, making it one of the most exclusive and quietest ultras in the region."
