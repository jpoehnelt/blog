  "summary": "The Devil Makes Three 50k and 10 Miler is a gritty, community-focused trail race set in the scenic woods of Waxhaw, North Carolina. Challenging runners with a mix of technical singletrack and prairie grass, the event embraces a 'misfits and monsters' theme that prioritizes the raw joy and discomfort of trail running over modern frills.",
  "uniqueFeatures": [
    "Loop-based 'Belly of the Beast' Course: The 50k distance requires runners to complete a scenic 10+ mile loop three times, passing through a central hub that tests their mental resolve on each circuit.",
    "Basecamp Pit Stop Culture: The start and finish line is located in a wide-open field where runners are encouraged to set up their own personal aid stations with tents and canopies, fostering a festive and communal atmosphere.",
    "Minimalist 'Mayhem' Philosophy: The race is intentionally designed with a low entry fee and a cupless format, focusing on an inclusive experience for self-proclaimed 'misfits' and 'monsters' who value rugged adventure over commercial amenities."
