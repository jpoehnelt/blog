  "summary": "The Black Canyon Ultras is a premier point-to-point ultramarathon traversing the historic Black Canyon National Recreation Trail through the heart of Arizona's Sonoran Desert. Starting in Spring Valley and finishing near Phoenix, the course is famous for its deceptively fast net-downhill profile that transitions into a rugged and technical second half.",
  "uniqueFeatures": [
    "Western States Golden Ticket Race: It serves as a prestigious qualifying event where the top finishers earn automatic entry into the world-renowned Western States 100-Mile Endurance Run.",
    "Historic Trail Corridor: The course follows a route of deep historical significance, originally used as a prehistoric travel path for Native Americans and later as a 19th-century livestock driveway and stagecoach road.",
    "Technical Desert Terrain: Despite a net elevation loss, runners must navigate multiple crossings of the Agua Fria River and manage extreme exposure across a landscape of saguaro forests and rocky canyons."
