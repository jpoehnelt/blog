  "summary": "The Black Canyon Ultras is a premier point-to-point race through Arizona's rugged Sonoran Desert, following the historic Black Canyon National Recreation Trail from Mayer to New River. Renowned for its high-stakes status as a Golden Ticket qualifier for the Western States 100, the course challenges runners with technical singletrack, iconic saguaro forests, and multiple river crossings.",
  "uniqueFeatures": [
    "The race serves as a prestigious Golden Ticket event, granting top finishers automatic entry into the world-famous Western States 100-Mile Endurance Run.",
    "The course follows a historic National Recreation Trail that originated as a 1,000-year-old Indigenous trade path and later became a federally designated livestock driveway in 1919.",
    "While the race is a net-downhill course, it is notoriously deceptive due to rocky technical terrain and multiple crossings of the Agua Fria River that can swell rapidly with seasonal snowmelt."
