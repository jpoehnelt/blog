  "summary": "Infinitus is a grueling multi-day trail running festival held in Vermont's Green Mountain National Forest that tests the limits of human endurance on technical, mountainous terrain. Organized by the Endurance Society, the event is famous for its 'infinity' theme and a range of distances that peak at a massive 888-kilometer odyssey lasting ten full days.",
  "uniqueFeatures": [
    "The 888k Flagship Distance: One of the longest trail races in the world, the 888k (roughly 551 miles) gives runners a 240-hour cutoff to complete a relentless series of technical loops.",
    "Infinity-Themed Structure: To honor the symbol for infinity, the course is designed as a figure-eight loop, and all race distances traditionally begin at exactly 8:08 AM.",
    "Communal 'Suffer-Fest' Atmosphere: Participants in the longer distances often stay in shared dorms at the Silver Towers camp venue, creating a unique community where athletes eat, sleep, and recover together between loops."
