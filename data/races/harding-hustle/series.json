  "summary": "Held in the rugged Santa Ana Mountains of Orange County, California, the Harding Hustle is a grueling trail race known for its relentless climbs and intense summer heat. The course primarily utilizes the historic Harding Truck Trail, pushing runners through the remote chaparral of Cleveland National Forest to reach the highest summits in the region.",
  "uniqueFeatures": [
    "Orange County Summit: The 50K course summits Santiago Peak, which at 5,689 feet is the highest point in Orange County, offering 360-degree views of the Pacific Ocean and the Inland Empire.",
    "Mini-Badwater Conditions: Intentionally scheduled in the peak of July, the race is famous for punishing triple-digit temperatures that have led seasoned veterans to describe it as a 'mini-Badwater' experience.",
    "Significant Vertical Gain: Despite being run mostly on a fire road, the 50K distance packs nearly 6,000 feet of elevation gain, featuring a 'prominous' ascent that tests the limits of even the most experienced ultra-runners."
