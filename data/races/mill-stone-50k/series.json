  "summary": "The Mill Stone 50K is a rugged trail ultramarathon held in the scenic Anne Springs Close Greenway of Fort Mill, South Carolina, featuring a challenging triple-loop course through technical single-track terrain. Runners must navigate multiple creek crossings and thick mud while participating in a quirky local tradition of touching a historic millstone deep in the woods for good luck.",
  "uniqueFeatures": [
    "The Stone Tradition: Runners are strongly encouraged to touch an original historic millstone from Webb's Mill, the very landmark for which Fort Mill is named.",
    "Non-Urban Greenway: Contrary to its name, the course features no pavement or groomed paths, consisting instead of technical single-track and dirt trails within a private green space.",
    "Hydraulic Obstacles: Each of the three 10.5-mile loops includes at least two mandatory creek crossings and is notorious for heavy mud conditions during its annual February date."
