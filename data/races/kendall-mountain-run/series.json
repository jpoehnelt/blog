  "summary": "The Kendall Mountain Run is a historic 12-mile high-altitude challenge in Silverton, Colorado, that tasks runners with a brutal 3,750-foot vertical ascent to a 13,066-foot summit. Dating back to a legendary 1908 bar bet, the course follows rugged Jeep roads before concluding with a technical high-altitude scramble and a breakneck descent back to town.",
  "uniqueFeatures": [
    "Bar Bet Origins: The race commemorates a 1908 wager where a Silverton miner bet he could summit the peak and return in under 90 minutes, establishing it as one of the oldest mountain running traditions in the United States.",
    "Vertical Intensity: Participants climb nearly 3,800 vertical feet in just 6 miles, starting at 9,318 feet and finishing the ascent with a precarious, technical scramble over loose scree and talus to reach the 13,066-foot summit marker.",
    "The Mountain Duo Challenge: The race is a centerpiece of a premier trail weekend, where athletes can earn the 'Mountain Duo' title by completing a 50K ultramarathon on Saturday followed by the steep Kendall peak run on Sunday."
