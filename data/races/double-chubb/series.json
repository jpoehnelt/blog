  "summary": "The Double Chubb is a gritty, scenic ultramarathon held in Eureka, Missouri, that challenges runners with two out-and-back loops along the rugged Chubb Trail. Traversing the scenic bluffs and bottomlands of the Meramec River, the race offers a punishing mix of technical single-track, steep limestone 'steps,' and flat river-side sprints.",
