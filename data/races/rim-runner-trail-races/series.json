  "summary": "Held in the rugged Franklin State Forest of Sewanee, Tennessee, the Rim Runner Trail Races offer a range of distances from a half-marathon to a grueling 100-miler. Runners navigate technical singletrack loops along the edges of dramatic sandstone coves, experiencing a landscape filled with hidden waterfalls, ancient stone bridges, and panoramic overlooks.",
  "uniqueFeatures": [
    "Bootlegging Heritage: The race's name is a double entendre, referring both to the rim-side course and Tennessee's historic 'rum running' or bootlegging legacy during the prohibition era.",
    "Artisanal Finisher Awards: Participants earn distinctive handmade trophies, including three-layer welded steel buckles for the 100-mile finishers and hand-branded whiskey barrel staves for the shorter distances.",
    "Strategic Sunrise Timing: Start times are intentionally calculated so that ultramarathon runners reach the eastern edge of the course exactly as the sun rises over the Tennessee coves."
