With this you can do things like set a user’s Gmail settings including signatures, authenticate as a user in Google Chat and much more.\nA quick way to use a service account is to download a JSON key. The challenge then given the potential capabilities of service accounts is securely storing the JSON key. A alternative approach, which is explained in this post by Justin Poehnelt, is using Apps Script to create and fetch a short-lived credential for your service account.\nShort-lived credentials are highly recommended for applications requiring robust security and precise access control for service accounts, reducing the attack surface and the risks with accidentally exposing static secrets.\nYou can find out more include code snippets/setup in Justin’s post which also links to the support documentation.\nSource: Apps Script Service Account Impersonation | Justin PoehneltMartin HawkseyMember of Google Developers Experts Program for Google Workspace (Google Apps Script) and interested in supporting Google Workspace Devs.\nmashe.hawksey.info\n\nRelated Posts:\nUsing Google Sheets via BigQuery from Google Apps Script with service accounts\nHow to force subscribe a user in your domain to a Google Calendar with Google Apps Script [and Domain Wide…\nHow to Use Service Accounts and OAuth2 in Google Apps Script"
