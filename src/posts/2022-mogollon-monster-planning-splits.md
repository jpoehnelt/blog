I just signed up for the Mogollon Monster 100 mile race for 2022. [Last year I finished in a little over 29 hours](/posts/mogollon-monster-100-2021/), good for 11th, and this year I am setting __my target at 24 hours__!

> All Mogollon Monster finishers of the race will receive a finishers buckle.  A special buckle will be awarded to those that complete the race under 24 hours.

I want that belt buckle!

## Mogollon Monster Splits

Below are the [splits for my 2021 run](https://live.aravaiparunning.com/#/mogollon_monster-2021/103314), compared to Jeff Browning, and my target finish for 2022. It's probably a little ambitious! :joy:

<div>
    <table class="w-full">
    <thead>
    <tr class="font-bold bg-gray-800 text-xl border-b-2 mb-2">
    <th>Aid Station</th>
    <th>Distance</th>
    <th>Last Year</th>
    <th>Jeff Browning</th>
    <th>Target</th>            
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    {% for split in splits -%}
    <tr class="even:bg-gray-800 border-b-2 border-gray-900 py-4 px-2">
        <td>{{split.location }}</td>
        <td>{{split.distance }}</td>
        <td>Duration: {{ split.last.duration }}</br>Pace: {{ split.last.pace }}</br>Time: {{ split.last.time }}</td>
        <td>Duration: {{ split.jeff.duration }}</br>Pace: {{ split.jeff.pace }}</br>Time: {{ split.jeff.time }}</td>
        <td>Duration: {{ split.target.duration }}</br>Pace: {{ split.target.pace }}</br>Time: {{ split.target.time }}</td>
    </tr>
    {% endfor -%}
    </tbody>
    </table>

## Other estimates

## Changes for 2022

- No gut/nausea issues. I better at managing this now. :poop: :no_entry_sign:
- Cooler temperatures - It is forecast to be cloudy and 10 degrees cooler than last year. :sun_behind_large_cloud:
- The earlier start (1 hour) and a slightly faster pace means I will be running in the pines more for the hottest part of the day. :sunrise_over_mountains:
- Better fitness :anatomical_heart: :lungs: :muscle:
- More experience with 100 milers. The 2021 Mogollon Monster was my first 100 miler that I finished. :brain:
- My luck shoes that have gotten me a 1st and 2nd in my last two races :athletic_shoe:
- I know the course. :world_map:
- Luck :four_leaf_clover:
