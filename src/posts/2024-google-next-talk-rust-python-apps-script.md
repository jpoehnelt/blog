I will be giving a talk at Google Next 2024 on how to use Rust, Python and WASM to extend Google Apps Script. The full title is _Unleashing the power of Rust, Python, and WebAssembly in Apps Script_.

See the session details at: [Lightning Talk](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next?session=IHLT300)

Step one is getting it to build and be compatible with Apps Script. Here is a short video demonstrating Rust, WASM, and ESBuild. I will be sharing the slides and code after the talk. Stay tuned!
