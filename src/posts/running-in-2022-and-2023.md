In 2022 I ran nearly 2400 miles and have big plans for 2023!

## 2022 - Racing and injuries

In 2022, I ran 2351 miles and [numerous ultra marathons](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Justin&lname=Poehnelt). Much of my season was marked by injury and too many races. Both 200+ mile races I attempted I started injured and couldn't persevere as would be expected.

- 200+: Moab 240 (DNF), Cocodona 250 (DNF)
- 100 mile: Mace's Hideout 100, Creede 100, Mogollon Monster 100
- 50 mile: San Juan Solstice 50, Ute 50
- 50k: Moab Red Hot, Behind the Rocks, Sedona Stage Race (2), Arches Ultra

An upside to 2022 was that I won my first race and podiumed in some others. It was the most competitive year for me and I was in the lead for over a 100 miles across 3 different races!

## 2023 - Coaching and focused racing

For the upcoming year, I have officially signed up for a running coach with [CTS](https://trainright.com/). I currently have the following races on the calendar. More to be added soon!

- [Canyons 100 mile](https://canyons.utmb.world/) in April
- [Moab 240](https://www.destinationtrailrun.com/moab) in October (depends on lottery and waitlist)

Canyons is new to me (I need some UTMB stones). The Moab 240 is about getting redemption on a [previous DNF in 2022](/posts/2022-moab-240-race-report/). 

For distance in 2023, I'm aiming for about 3000 miles!
