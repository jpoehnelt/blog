## Software Engineer

I am a **Developer Relations Engineer** at Google for Google Maps Platform with a background in geospatial applications and satellite imagery. Previously I worked at [Descartes Labs](https://www.descarteslabs.com/) and the [US Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/).

Approximately two thirds of my work is supporting open source and much of that is within the [Google Maps GitHub organization](https://github.com/googlemaps). The remainder of my development work is internal to Google and focused on fixing bugs, enabling new features, and creating processes that create a better development experience.

## Open Source Development Stats
I am active on GitHub and track some of my development activity for open source.
